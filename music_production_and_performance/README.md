# Tools for Music Production and Performance

Code I use for all things music:  Production, Live Shows, DJ Work and Composition.

There is not much here for now... currently scoping this project out.

Basically I'm storing ideas for future consideration.

## What we have so far:

#### The "DJ" directory

So far, this directory contains a module for computing Camelot wheels, a tool commonly used by DJs to ensure key changes when mixing two tracks sound consonant. The idea is to later use this code when developing software for automatically generating set lists.

Future additions to this directory will include software for altering RekordBox libraries.

#### The "frequency" directory

Function(s) for computing frequency values for given notes, and, in the future, vice-versa.

#### The "theory/western/scales" directory

Here I begin working out a framework for describing and using scale definitions. Very much a work in progress.

#### "mpp.ipynb"

This notebook explores the relationship between MIDI notation and scientific pitch notation. Exploratory.
