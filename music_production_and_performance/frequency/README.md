# Frequency-Related Calculations

This directory contains a library for calculating (equal-tempered, 12-tone-based) frequency given a MIDI note number.

Future additions may accept input of (scientific pitch notation)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation] instead of MIDI note numbers, and may cover non-equal-tempered tuning systems in the future.
