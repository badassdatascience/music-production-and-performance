# Scale Formulations

This directory contains several scale formulations, as I figure out which formulations make the most sense moving forward.

All scales are defined here are C based. Anything else can be calculated from these.

## Chromatic Formulations

Here I wrestle with enharmonic spellings.

## C Major Formulation

This formulation is (will be) used for transposition such that interval and enharmonic considerations are propagated through the transposition process in a manner consistent with Western classical music theory circa 1800.
